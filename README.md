Repository for my digital portfolio. This is a from-scratch website that will automatically allows me to update/add project information simply in a JSON file.

***NOTE The source for the (Old) Angular Version of this site can be found on the [`angular` branch](https://github.com/rhit-westeraj/rhit-westeraj.github.io/tree/angular)***

## Frameworks/Libraries

I would be a liar if I claimed all of this work as my own. Here are all of the library dependencies used in the deployed version of the website.

- ReactJS 18 (<https://reactjs.org>)
- MUI 5 (<https://material-ui.com>)

### Old Angular Version

- Angular 13 (<https://angular.io>)
- Angular Material 13 (<https://material.angular.io>)
- NerdFonts (For Icons) (<https://nerdfonts.com>)

## Todo-List

I don't have issues setup on the repository because I don't expect bug reports, but I am aware of certain issues that need to be fixed. Here is the current list of items I am planning to work on other than continuing to maintain based on my current and future projects:

- [x] Responsive Mobile UI
- [ ] Project Tagging System
- [ ] More ways to show projects (Open to suggestions!)

Keep in mind the template will receive all changes that this site gets, so if you choose to use the template early, be careful of merging from upstream!
