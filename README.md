# rhit-westeraj.github.io

Repository for my digita portfolio. This is a from-scratch website that will automatically allows me to update/add project information simply in a JSON file.

## Can I use this as a template?

Of course! I would wait a bit as I am currently making a "template" so that other people can use this. Keep in mind that I am still working on new features (especially responsive mobile UI), but expect a easy to use, enter and forget template ***SOON&trade;*** (like probably next week, but we'll see).

(BTW the ***SOON&trade;*** joke is not mine, its from New Blood Interactive. Go check their stuff out! @ <https://newblood.games>)

## Frameworks/Libraries

I would be a liar if I claimed all of this work as my own. Here are all of the library dependencies used in the deployed version of the website.

- Angular 12.2.8 (<https://angular.io>)
- Angular Material 12.2.8 (<https://material.angular.io>)
- NerdFonts (For Icons) (<https://nerdfonts.com>)

I also use the following for CI and Deployment

- Github Pages
- Github Actions

## Todo-List

I don't have issues setup on the repository because I don't expect bug reports, but I am aware of certain issues that need to be fixed. Here is the current list of items I am planning to work on other than continuing to maintain based on my current and future projects:

- [ ] Responsive Mobile UI
- [ ] Project Tagging System
- [ ] Auto-Attachment of Icons for Languages
- [ ] More ways to show projects (Open to suggestions!)

Keep in mind the template will receive all changes that this site gets, so if you choose to use the template early, be careful of merging from upstream!
