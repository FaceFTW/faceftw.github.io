				<p>Since I was 12 years old, I've been cultivating my interests in computers and technology. I
					taught myself how to program, use breadboards, prototype basic electronic solutions, and
					disassembling/salvaging old computers. Whether it was speed disassembling and reassembling
					TI-84s out of pure boredom in middle school, figuring out how to remount a LUKS encrypted drive
					for decryption over many high school lunches for a friend, or even helping my grandparents
					understand social engineering attacks that they are often vulnerable to, I always try to expand
					my understanding in the broadest reach possible. This has allowed me to perceive problems and
					projects from a multi-faceted perspective, and make guided decisions to accelerate workflow.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I created this portfolio to demonstrate my knowledge and showcase some of the projects,
					regardless if academic, professional, or personal, that I am proud of. I intend for this to also
					be a way to show what I am actively working on, updating it as new projects start or finish,
					keeping my self from the old programmer habit of starting thousands of projects never to see the
					light of day. I love open-source software because reverse engineering source files and doing
					small tweaks was one of the ways I learned to program, so most of my projects are open source
					under a permissive license (unless otherwise stated).</p>
