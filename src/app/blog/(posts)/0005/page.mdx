# From the Archives: Why I revised this Website 4 Times

_A history of this website and anecdotes of the pains of modern web development_

Recently, I upgraded this entire website with yet another fresh coat of paint. Originally started as a project for a introductory web development course during college, I kept adding to it and improving it to do something new: code-less additions of new projects, refining visuals for mobile, supporting _this very blog_. But each time I had to make a "radical change" like the ones I mentioned it always involved migrating to the next big thing. It's been over 3 years of this site being upgrade and with the creation of this blog (`ref_cycle`) I thought it would be an interesting retrospective in terms of what was great about certain revisions, and what could be better (both design and my experience with the tools I used).

Since the Git repository of the website is public (since it started as a GitHub pages project), I'll be linking to commits that one

So sit back and get your snack of choice, time for another trip back in time.



## Humble Beginnings
commit [`f2c6164e`](https://github.com/FaceFTW/faceftw.github.io/tree/f2c6164efe66bbb86e2bd40d45e9ba52592dfbf3)

This site is actually not that bad from the looks of it. Aside from the raw HTML that makes the code look scary, there is a lot to like visually. At this stage of the site, there was not much stuff I wanted to show; I didn't have many projects to show and also thought writing for fun was cringe (the irony). The main purpose was to effectively serve as a "second" resume for people to look at, especially as a demonstration of skill.

This version of the site used [Bootstrap (4?)](https://getbootstrap.com/) with a dark theme from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/), which I like and dislike (compared to [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) which I discuss later). Bootstrap is great with things like simple layouts and defining things like the cards for projects. For the most part, it's also fairly quick to setup, just include the Bootstrap CSS bundle as a `link` tag and you are basically off to the races. The only major thing is that when you need to deviate from the standard `container` and other elements you have to start writing more of your own CSS, which increases some confusion on what is from Bootstrap and what I wrote. (Tailwind does solve this problem somewhat, I'll also discuss this later).

### What was wrong with this then?

At this time, I started taking on more projects, courses at college, and internships. Plus, HTML is the kind of language where you always feel like you want to write _less of it_. I mean, use inspect element on a modern webpage and you'll see an absurd number of `div`s and nesting. I'd rather not spend time maintaining that if I could.

Luckily, this was around the time I started to learn my first web framework.

## V2 - The Angular Revision

commit [``]()

//Insert V2 Homepage here

The first web framework I learned was [Angular](https://angular.dev) (not the really old AngularJS), the web framework from Google. Compared to the raw HTML/CSS/JS combination that I started with, Angular is what I consider to be an "augmentation" of the paradigm. With the [component model](https://angular.dev/essentials/components), first-class support for [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/), and easier reactive programming, it became the first choice for some of the projects I did in the same web design course.
