# "Another 10 Years of Game Design Discourse"

_Yet another essay on how game design should work from someone who doesn't make the games_

I've played a lot of video games. I've been immersed in the medium since a young age and have developed my own opinions on what I think is a good game. But open Twitter and YouTube and you see the "cesspool" of takes on "why X game good" or "why Y game bad" or "X series has gone woke don't play it".

While I'm not interested in the last point there (if you believe that stuff you are clearly being manipulated), but the discussion about what makes a game "good" or "bad" is interesting to discuss, even when put in subjective lenses; I don't like JRPGs but seeing why people like [Persona]() and 100% a game that takes over 100 hours to complete on average is intriguing.

As someone who works on software, learned about defining and managing requirements, and worked on fairly complex systems (so far), I want to try and frame game design within a more "objective" lens by focusing on what makes good _gameplay_. I'll try to avoid discussing the artistic and narrative choices of games since _that should be subjectively interpreted_ (no [Last of Us 2 bad]() jokes unfortunately); Game optimization/delivery and public perception are also going to be out of scope as well since that involves a discussion about the industry/gaming community at large and good development practice. _This means the general focus of this article will be about game mechanics and analyzing them in a requirements' lens._

## What Games do I Like

As someone with 777 games in my Steam library (as of writing), I've got a bunch of games that I've completed, a bunch that I've dropped, and a bunch that I haven't picked up; Using categories to track games that I completed, I've finished the story of 199 games (25.2%), of those I've fully completed

## Defining an Archetype

To prevent this from becoming a rambling mess, I will define the notion of an "archetype" of a good game; This will define a rough system or idea that is fundamental to the game's design, such as a core mechanic or gameplay flow/loop. These aren't formal definitions and aren't supposed to fit a single genre of game, rather it's used to identify a common trait that makes a game good. I should also clarify that a lack of these archetypes doesn't make a game inherently bad, in fact I'm only going to cover a few archetypes of games that I really like.

Let's dive in then, shall we?

### _I can break the game_

As someone who limit tests their own electronics all the time, being able to do that to a game without a destructive consequence is a great outlet to vent that tendency. Games in this archetype have some system or gameplay loop that if "exploited" correctly can create some form of exponential growth that the player can use to achieve the objective faster or with more certainty. [Rogue-like]() games are best suited for this archetype with their general structure revolving around failure and a fixed objective the player attempts to complete each run, but not all games fit this archetype exactly. In fact, here is a Reddit meme that demonstrates the point:

One of the primary examples that easily fits this category is [Risk of Rain](https://store.steampowered.com/app/248820/Risk_of_Rain_2013/)(Hopoo Games, 2013 + 2023 Remaster) and it's sequel [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/)(Hopoo Games, 2020). The premise is simple: you are a survivor of a crashed intergalactic freighter trying to escape the uncharted planet you crash-landed on.
