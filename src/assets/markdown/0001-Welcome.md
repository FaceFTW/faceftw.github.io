# Welcome to the Blog

Welcome to the first "blog" post I've created. It's not the usual kind of blog that has an RSS feed (yet) and has no direct focus but I plan on *occasionally* venting thoughts or breakdown technical details of things I think are cool. While this could totally devolve into ramblings about __why [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) is a great language__ or other insane things like __Windows being a pretty ok developer platform__, it's too early to make a judgement on where this will go.

Again, I'm writing on my own time and with my own passion, so I don't know where this will go. If this gets really popular, I'll consider adding ways to support me as a way to incentivize continuing this work. Who knows. The future is uncertain.

Aside from this welcome, the inagural blog post will be based on some design journals I wrote for a project while in College making a Java linter (which is open source but I would not recommend using it compared to established tools!). It's something I think shows a lot of how I think and reason about things and has some interesting surface-level insights about program analysis. Should you read it? _I'd like you to but it's your choice._
